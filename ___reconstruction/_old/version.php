	    We are still developing FontApp to make it a better tool.<br>
	    For our next version we are planning to:<br><br>
	    &#183; make cookies, so your adjustments will be saved on your computer.<br>
	    &#183; give you the option to send a FontApp-link with your adjustments enclosed in the URL. (So you can send a mail to your client to propose a font)<br>
	    &#183; add more fonts<br>
	    &#183; allow for more textfields in the Poster mode<br><br>
	    Like us on Facebook and we'll keep you updated!
